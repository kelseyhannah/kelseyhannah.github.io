						<h2>About Me</h2>

						<h4>Biography</h4>
						<p>Born near the geographic center of Tennessee, Kelsey Hannah spent
							her early childhood playing in dirt, climbing trees, collecting insects,
							whistling at birds and recording these experiences and creatures in the form of,
							at first, very inaccurate drawings. Driven inside her own mind by her shy personality and
							volatile home environment, she found an obsession with accurately depicting what she saw in the world around her.
							In 2011/2012 she won Best in Show for a self portrait done in pastel and graphite. After graduating
							from Riverdale High School in 2014, she was accepted into Middle Tennessee State University and will
							graduate in Fall of 2018 with  a Bachelors of Arts in  Japanese Language and Literature accompanied by a minor in art.
							Throughout her college career, Kelsey has accepted and fulfilled a wide range of commissions including
							portraiture to digital prints. In 2016/2018 she was commissioned by a small business based in Ohio
							called Shipping Hip to design patterns and post cards for stationary and polymailers.
							In Spring of 2018 her work was/ is shown at Moxie Art Supply and Just Love Coffee Roasters where it can still be seen today.
							Focusing primarily on oils, watercolor, and ink, she created paintings that elevate the minuscule and mundane into images of
							respect and dare she say, worship. Following her graduation in Fall, Kelsey will continue to work freelance and soon after pursue
							a Master of Fine Arts in Painting from the University of her choosing.

							<h4>Artist Statement</h4>
							<p>Rooted in Naturalist philosophy, my work breeds flora and fauna and amalgamates these hybrids
                                with sacred geometry and symbolism sourced from many faiths and spiritualities. Using art to explore
                                the idea that we all acknowledge the presence and authority that the natural world exerts over us, I hope
                                to provoke thought on the purpose of religion, itâ€™s origins and how it both connects and tears us from nature.
                                By aspiring to draw attention to and educate my audience on the uncommon, endangered, or extinct species that
                                we continue to exploit, I hope yo create simultaneous senses of solidarity with the natural world around us. </p>
